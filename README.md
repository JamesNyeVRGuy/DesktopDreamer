This is a batch file and python script that calls the OpenAI Api through Python3!

Please grab your API Key from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and paste it as the first line in the AI.key file (edit with Notepad)

After that you can populate interests.txt with your interests! Put your new interests line by line

Each time this file is run it will cost you about 8cents, worth it in my opinion to have a cool new UNIQUE background every day

If you really want to be special, you can setup Task Scheduler to run the batch script every time you log in to your computer!
